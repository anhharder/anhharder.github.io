I'm a mathematician working in algebraic geometry and related areas. My research focuses on questions in algebraic geometry with roots in mathematical physics. A non-comprehensive list of problems that I have worked on include:
* Classification of K3 fibred Calabi--Yau threefolds
* The Hodge theory and moduli theory of Landau--Ginzburg models and their relationship to Fano varieties
* Describing the motives underlying certain Feynman integrals
* Degenerations of hyperk√§hler and Calabi--Yau varieties and geometric d escriptions of the monodromy weight filtration
